# Basic-Voice-Assistant
Basic Voice Assistant in Python

This is a basic application of the voice recognition in python. It just recognises the user voice commands and generates response accordingly. 
This project has limited outcomes for now, but certainly has potential to be developed even further.
This project is easy to understand and contains all the knowledge necessary to learn the voice recognition and kickstart your own project.
